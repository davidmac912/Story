It was the best of space, it was the worst of space.

...it was the best space. Don't mean to ruin your story, was just trying out forking and pull request after watching your tutorial on udemy. I bought the course and gave it a five star and i think you deserve more than that, anyway, i have completed 227 lectures so far in a space of two months, i'm working on a capstone project that i'm going to sell to a company at 10,000$, hope i can send 100$ for a thankyou coffee--to your crypto wallet but i don't have your address, so i'm gona wait till you pull that request with your wallet address. thanks, if you don't mind i would also like to tell you that the Lord Jesus Christ loves you so much. Feel free not to accept this pull request haha. all the best.
